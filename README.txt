To run our project:

using Python 2.7, run main.py.

This calls the function main(), training a single perceptron as well as a two-layer artificial neural network on the
training data set, and then prints the accuracy of each classification method on both the validation and training sets.

If you'd like to change the neural network learning parameters, they are defined as constants at the top of main.py.

The training, validation, and test data sets can also be switched out by changing the corresponding file path constants at the top of main.py. Any csv files where each line consists of a 1 or -1 corresponding to the class of that instance, followed by a sequence of some number of 0s and 1s corresponding to the features of that instance should be compatible with the code we wrote.
