To run our project:

using Python 2.7, run main.py.

This calls the function main(), training a single perceptron as well as a two-layer artificial neural network on the
training data set, and then prints the accuracy of each classification method on both the validation and training sets.

If you'd like to change the neural network learning parameters, they are defined as constants at the top of main.py.
